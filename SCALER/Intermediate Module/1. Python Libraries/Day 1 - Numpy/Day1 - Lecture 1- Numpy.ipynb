    "NumPy arrays and Python lists are both used to store collections of data, but they have several key differences that make them suitable for different tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Type Consistency\n",
    "Python Lists: Can store elements of different types (e.g., integers, floats, strings, objects).\n",
    "NumPy Arrays: Store elements of the same data type, which makes them more efficient for numerical computations.\n",
    "2. Performance\n",
    "Python Lists: Slower for large datasets, as Python lists are implemented as arrays of pointers to objects, leading to higher memory consumption and slower operations.\n",
    "NumPy Arrays: Much faster due to optimized low-level implementations in C, and the fact that NumPy stores data in contiguous blocks of memory. This allows for efficient computations, especially with large datasets.\n",
    "3. Size Flexibility\n",
    "Python Lists: Can grow and shrink dynamically, allowing for the insertion and deletion of elements.\n",
    "NumPy Arrays: Fixed in size once created. Resizing an array requires creating a new array and copying the data.\n",
    "4. Mathematical Operations\n",
    "Python Lists: Element-wise operations (e.g., addition, multiplication) need to be implemented using loops or list comprehensions.\n",
    "NumPy Arrays: Support vectorized operations, meaning you can apply operations to the entire array at once without needing to write loops. This is both more efficient and simpler.\n",
    "5. Functionality\n",
    "Python Lists: More general-purpose, flexible containers for objects.\n",
    "NumPy Arrays: Specialized for numerical computing and provide functions for linear algebra, Fourier transforms, random number generation, and more.\n",
    "6. Memory Consumption\n",
    "Python Lists: Take more memory, as they store references to objects, which can be of different types.\n",
    "NumPy Arrays: More memory-efficient since all elements are of the same type and stored in contiguous memory.\n",

    "3. Numpy is able to divide a task into multiple subtasks and process them parallely."
